This is a C++-Qt based program which enables user to compare two rows in an excel file and moving the different ones to a new file.  I used QPushButton function for making buttons for file opening then an option to user for creating new file after comparing. Inside function of these triggers, I used QAxObject class which is more appropriate to read an excel file with. In addition, I used QXlsx module, which provides a set of classes to read and write excel files. It does not require excel Microsoft Excel and can be used in any platform that QT5 supported. I used this library to generate a new .xlsx file from scratch and extract data from the existing one and edit it. And as a final step, I used xlsx_database function to save the newly created file into my pc.
